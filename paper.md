# Summary

# Statement of Need

R is a programming language geared towards statistical software and visualisations.
From its inception, R was meant to be extended, providing tools for building
dynamic libraries in Fortran/C/C++ natively. On Windows, the R-project provides
a toolchain Rtools, which bundles developer environment for Fortran, C and C++.
In Extending R [@chambers2017extending] details interfacing with Python, Julia
and C++, which is written by an R-core developer. R provides a C-API by default,
together with command line utilities to compile dynamic libraries for use in R.

There are several R packages that facilitates binding to various programming languages,
Rcpp [@rcpp_cran] and cpp11 [@cpp11] for C++, Java via rJava [@rJava], Python
with `reticulate` [@reticulate_cran], and JavaScript on the V8 runtime and the
V8 R-package [@v8_cran]. These packages aim to provide R users a developer environment
for their respective languages, auto-generate boilerplate, etc.

In order to achieve reasonable performance in R, package developers need to
embed extension code in their packages. This is partially why Rcpp is used
by the majority of packages on CRAN, the official R-package repository for R[@vriesAndriePagerank2021]. However, performance is not the only virtue that
Scientists require in a compiled language, and Rust has other features that
scientists with ever growing computational needs, have gravitated towards [@perkelWhyScientistsAre2020]. For instance, Rust uses declarative memory management,
i.e. there are compile-time analysis on memory safety.
<!-- 
Extendr provides integration the R data model, embedding calls to R within Rust,
automatically generated wrappers, provide an R-based developer interface for Rust, -->
<!-- and much more. -->
<!-- Like with Fortran/C/C++, -->
<!-- Rust does not have a garbage collector (gc) -->
<!-- This is what extendr provides, an integration of R's data-model, l -->

Extendr is a suite of software packages, comparable to Rcpp and cpp11.
Includes `libR-sys` which is a crate
providing Rust bindings to R's C-API. Then the main three crates are `extendr-api`, `extendr-engine`,
and `extendr-macros`. These crates provide an R data model in Rust, embedding of R in Rust code.
Lastly, an R-package `rextendr`, which is R users developer environment for Rust.

# Getting Started

First, ensure that Rust is installed, by following [Install Rust on rust-lang.org](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install). Then in an R terminal,

```r
install.packages("rextendr") 
# remotes::install_github("extendr/rextendr") # latest dev-version
usethis::create_package("exampleRustRpkg")
rextendr::use_extendr()
```

The function `use_extendr` setups up the necessary boilerplate for building
Rust library together with an R package. An R-package may be constructed using
the `usethis` R-package [@usethis_cran].

To refresh the wrappers generated, use `rextendr::document()`, as this augments
a call to `devtools::document()`.

<!-- Rust project is in `exampleRustRpkg/src/rust/`. -->

# Features

Features that extendr aims towards

- Integrate R's data model within Rust through `extendr-api`
- Auto-generate R wrappers for embedded Rust code, via `extendr-macros`
- Embed R inside of Rust for use in unit-testing, integration testing, etc. through `extendr-engine`
- Integrate Rust's packaging in R and its package build system, see`rextendr`
- Tools to help adhere to CRAN's extensive rules for publishing Rust-powered R-packages

API documentation for all the extendr packages are available at [extendr.github.io](https://extendr.github.io/),
and the repositories for extendr-packages are under GitHub organisation [github.com/extendr](https://github.com/extendr/).

<!-- `rextendr` also have `rust_source` and `rust_function` equivalent to `Rcpp`'s functions, where arbitrary rust code can be evaluated, and the result is relayed back to R. -->

## Mirroring R's Data model in Rust

Most R data is vector-based, even scalar values are 1-unit vectors. These vectors
are represented in Rust as slices `&[T]` / `&mut [T]`. R data may be allocated
in Rust, but these are invisible to R's garbage collector, and thus have to
be protected. `extendr-api` registers R allocated data in an internal hash-map / dictionary,
that stores a reference count for Rust allocated R data. In contrast, `cpp11` uses
a linked-list approach.

## Automagically generated wrappers for R

A C-function is callable in R, if it returns an `SEXP`, and all of its arguments
are `SEXP`s. These are opaque pointers to an internal R representation of data.
These are callable in R via `.Call`. A rust function is exported to R, must
have all of its arguments and return values convertible to `SEXP`. Annotating
it with `#[extendr]` will add a callable C-function in R, that converts the
custom data types into `SEXP`s.

The surrounding R-package need to know about the exported functions, their
expected signature, and provide the R equivalent code, that calls them via `.Call`
interface. This wrapper code is generated via `rextendr::document()`.
<!-- the type information is stored _in_ the generated rust library... -->

## Inline R execution in Rust

It is possible to instantiate R through its C-API. This allows for custom
R REPL implementations. This can be then be used to instantiate R within unit
tests, and R code can then be tested outside of a user-facing R instance.
Using embedding of R in a process is controversial, in that published packages
on CRAN are not allowed to have these C-API functions in the built package binaries.
This is also why Rcpp separated this capability into another R-package `RInside` [@rinside_cran], and extendr similarly relegates this functionality to `extendr-engine`.

## A rust developer interface in R

With `rextendr` there are `rust_source` and `rust_function`, where the former
evaluates arbitrary rust code, and returns the last value in the block, and
the latter compiles, wraps and returns arbitrary Rust functions. Rcpp provides
similar functions. These functions are very versatile, as they can also be used,
to include 3rd party crates.

For compiling Fortran/C/C++, R provides a CLI option `R CMD SHLIB`. This ensures
that the resulting binary is processed by R's internal build system. Similarly,
`rextendr::use_extendr()` provides Makevars-files, that adapts the compilation
process of an R-package with the embedded Rust binary.
<!-- Actually, we _could_ do a little better job with that, but this
  part is very sparsely documented by R-core...
 -->

## Publishing rust-powered R-packages

For R package authors, being able to publish their code on CRAN is essential.
However, CRAN have many rules for publishing packages in general, e.g. number
of threads that a package uses at build & testing must not exceed 2.

Uniquely, Rust has a package manager, which means that R packages have 3rd party
dependencies external to R and CRAN. These must be vendored. Since Fortran[^fortran_pkg_mgr]/C/C++ do not have official package managers. In `rextendr::` ...
<!-- TODO: please contribute to this bit @JosiahParry -->

[^fortran_pkg_mgr]: Fortran Package Manager is a community-driven project in alpha release as of this writing.

<!-- Today, we are seeing the proliferation of the Rust programming language. According to StackOverflow, Rust is the most admired programming language for many years runningâ€”and for good reason (<https://survey.stackoverflow.co/2023/>). Rust provides similar performance such as C and C++ while also being far more ergonomic ([@perkelWhyScientistsAre2020]). But most importantly, Rust provides guarantees memory that make exceptionally safe. For all of these reasons and more, providing R package developers a way to integrate Rust and R is necessary for the continued growth of the R ecosystem. The extendr Rust library and its companion R package `{rextendr}` make the process of marrying R and Rust simple. -->

<!-- ## Implementation

extendr utilizes R's C API via the libR-sys library crate. libR-sys utilizes the Rust library bindgen to automatically create foreign function interface (FFI) bindings for all major distributions (<https://github.com/rust-lang/rust-bindgen>). The bindings provided by libR-sys create Rust representations of the structs defined in R's C API. On top of these exceptionally low-level bindings, extendr is built. extendr defines a number of user friendly Rust structs that can be be passed directly to and from R and Rust. -->

# extendr packages in the R ecosystem

The rust-based DataFrame library [Polars](https://pola.rs/) has bindings to
python (via [`py-polars`](https://github.com/pola-rs/polars/tree/main/py-polars)) and to R via [`rpolars`](https://github.com/pola-rs/r-polars), where the latter is built with extendr.

An example of scientific computing enabled by extendr is [`changeforest`](https://github.com/mlondschien/changeforest/tree/main) [@JMLR:v24:22-0512].

[`rsgeo`](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/rsgeo/index.html) are bindings to [`geo-rust`](https://crates.io/crates/geo) geometry primitives and algorithms which are very performant. `rsgeo` is similar to the

<!-- ## Related work

Integration of Rust and R has been explored in other libraries. The `roxido` library crate and accompanying R package `cargo` by David B. Dahl are an alternative approach to creating Rust bindings ([@cargo_cran]). An offshoot of extendr, [savvy](https://github.com/yutannihilation/savvy), is an "unfriendly" lower-level approach to generating Rust and R bindings in which "ergonomics is not included.". -->
