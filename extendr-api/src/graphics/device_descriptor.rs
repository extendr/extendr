// # Design notes (which feels a bit too internal to be exposed as an official document)
//
// Compared to the original [DevDesc], `DeviceDescriptor` omits several fields
// that seem not very useful. For example,
//
// - `clipLeft`, `clipRight`, `clipBottom`, and `clipTop`: In most of the cases,
//   this should match the device size at first.
// - `xCharOffset`, `yCharOffset`, and `yLineBias`: Because I get [the
//   hatred](https://github.com/wch/r-source/blob/9f284035b7e503aebe4a804579e9e80a541311bb/src/include/R_ext/GraphicsDevice.h#L101-L103).
//   They are rarely used.
// - `gamma`, and `canChangeGamma`: These fields are now ignored because gamma
//   support has been removed.
// - `deviceSpecific`: This can be provided later when we actually create a
//   [Device].
// - `canGenMouseDown`, `canGenMouseMove`, `canGenMouseUp`, `canGenKeybd`, and
//   `canGenIdle`: These fields are currently not used by R and preserved only
//   for backward-compatibility.
// - `gettingEvent`, `getEvent`: This is set true when getGraphicsEvent is
//   actively looking for events. Reading the description on ["6.1.6 Graphics
//   events" of R
//   Internals](https://cran.r-project.org/doc/manuals/r-release/R-ints.html#Graphics-events),
//   it seems this flag is not what is controlled by a graphic device.
// - `canHAdj`: it seems this parameter is used only for tweaking the `hadj`
//   before passing it to the `text()` function. This tweak probably can be done
//   inside `text()` easily, so let's pretend to be able to handle any
//   adjustments... c.f.
