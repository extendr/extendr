## Code of Conduct

We take our open source community seriously and hold ourselves and other contributors to high standards of communication. By participating and contributing to this project, you agree to uphold our [Code of Conduct.](https://github.com/extendr/extendr/blob/main/CODE-OF-CONDUCT.md)

## Getting Started

Contributions can be made via Issues and Pull Requests (PRs). A few general guidelines cover both:

- Please search for existing Issues and PRs before creating your own.
- We work hard to makes sure issues are handled in a timely manner but, depending on the problem and maintainer availability, it could take a while to investigate the problem. A friendly ping in the comment thread can help draw attention if an issue has not received any attention for a while. Please keep in mind that all contributors to this project are volunteers and may have other commitments they need to attend to.

### Issues

Issues should be used to report problems with the library, request a new feature, or to discuss potential changes before a PR is created. Please **do not** use Issues to request user support.

Whenever possible, please provide a minimal reproducible example (reprex) to any bug report that you are filing. The more minimal your example, the more likely that somebody else can figure out what the problem is, so please remove any code that isn't relevant to the problem you are reporting.

Please keep issues focused on one particular problem. Don't feel shy about opening multiple issues if you're encountering more than one problem.

If you find an Issue that addresses the problem you're having, please add your own reproduction information to the existing issue rather than creating a new one. Adding a [reaction](https://github.blog/2016-03-10-add-reactions-to-pull-requests-issues-and-comments/) can also help be indicating to our maintainers that a particular problem is affecting more than just the reporter.

### Pull Requests

PRs are always welcome and can be a quick way to get your fix or improvement slated for the next release. However, please always open an Issue before submitting a PR.

In general, PRs should:

- Address a single concern in the least number of changed lines as possible.
- Only fix/add the functionality in question **OR** address wide-spread whitespace/style issues, not both.
- Add unit or integration tests for fixed or changed functionality.
- Include documentation.
- Indicate which Issue they address by using the words `Closes #<issue number>` or `Fixes #<issue number>` in the body of the PR and/or the git commit message. (See the [GitHub Documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/github/managing-your-work-on-github/linking-a-pull-request-to-an-issue#linking-a-pull-request-to-an-issue-using-a-keyword) for details about linking PRs to Issues and automatically closing Issues when merging PRs.)


In general, we follow the [GitHub flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/index.html) development model:

1. Fork the repository to your own Github account
2. Clone the project to your machine
3. Create a branch locally with a succinct but descriptive name
4. Commit changes to the branch
5. Push changes to your fork
6. Open a PR in our repository and follow the PR template so that we can efficiently review the changes.

## Getting Help

Please join us on our [Discord server](https://discord.gg/7hmApuc) for general conversations and questions that don't belong into a GitHub issue.

## Authorship

Contributors who have made multiple, sustained, and/or non-trivial contributions to the project may be added to the author list. New author names will always be added at the end of the list, so that author order reflects chronological order of joining the project. All authorship decisions are at the discretion of the current maintainers of the project.

## Attribution
