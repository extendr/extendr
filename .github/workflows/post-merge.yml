# This workflow tests bleeding-edge versions (R-devel and Rust nightly) after PRs are merged.
# These configs are NOT tested during PR checks to avoid blocking PRs on upstream changes.
# Only tests R-devel + stable Rust and R-release + nightly Rust combinations.
# R-release is tested in the PR checks.
