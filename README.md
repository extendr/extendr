This library aims to provide an interface that will be familiar to
first-time users of Rust or indeed any compiled language.

Anyone who knows the R library should be able to write R extensions.


This library is just being born, but goals are:

A macro-based interface to R internal functions and language
features.

Example:

```rust
let v = c!(1, 2, 3);
let l = list!(a=1, b=2);
print!(paste0!("v=", v, " l=", l));
```

Provide a safe wrapper for r objects with error handlng
and panic-free execution.

Example:

```rust
let s = r!("hello");
let i = r!(1);
let r = r!(1.0);
```

Provide iterator support for creation and consumption of r vectors.

Example:

```rust
let res = (1..=100).iter().collect::<RObj>();
for x in res.as_i32_slice() {
    println!("{}", x)?;
}
```

Provide a procedural macro to adapt Rust functions to R

Example:

```rust
#[export_function]
fn fred(a: i32) -> i32 {
    a + 1
}
```

In R:

```r

result <- .Call("fred", 1)

```
